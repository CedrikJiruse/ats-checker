# Aggressive profile (speed + stronger tailoring)
#
# How to use:
# - Copy these settings into your main config or have your loader overlay this file.
# - This profile prioritizes: faster throughput, more iterations, and stronger resume↔job alignment.
#
# Notes:
# - This file assumes your base config already defines [paths] and [ai] sections.
# - All values here are under [processing] because they are behavior knobs.
