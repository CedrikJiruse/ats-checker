# ATS Checker configuration (TOML)

# This file replaces the legacy `config.json`.
#
# Notes:
# - Most paths can be relative; the app will normalize them to absolute paths.
# - `tesseract_cmd` is optional. Use "" (empty string) to mean "unset".
# - Scoring weights are stored in a separate TOML file (see paths.scoring_weights_file).
# - Multi-agent settings live under [ai.agents.*].
