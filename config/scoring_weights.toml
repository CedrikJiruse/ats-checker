# ATS Checker Scoring Weights
#
# This file is consumed by `scoring.py` and MUST match its expected schema.
#
# Expected tables:
#   [resume.weights]  -> categories used by score_resume()
#   [job.weights]     -> categories used by score_job()
#   [match.weights]   -> categories used by score_match()
#
# Notes:
# - Weights are normalized per group (resume/job/match) so they do not need to sum to 1.
# - All category scores are expected to be in the range 0..100.
# - Unknown keys are ignored by the scorer.
#
# Overall weights for combining component scores into a single "iteration score".
# These weights are intended for the iterative resume improvement loop.
# (They are not currently consumed directly by `scoring.py`.)
